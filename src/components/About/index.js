          When an analytical mind meets creativity you get a Certified Full Stack Web Developer with a Masters of Accounting.

          I started my career selling total IT solutions to small and medium sized businesses at Dell Inc after graduating from Texas Tech University with a BS in Communication Studies in 2004.  Five years later, during the financial crisis of 2009, I left Dell Inc to pursue a Masters of Accounting degree from Texas A&M Corpus Christi.  While at TAMUCC I was awarded a Graduate Assistantship at the universityâ€™s Business Innovation Center where I helped startup businesses put their ideas into motion.

          Fast forward to today, I am now a full time Accountant working for one of the top Cardiothoracic Surgeons in South Texas.  I am also the sole Accountant for two other up and coming businesses.

        <p>
          My Accounting career has been reliable and rewarding but I desire something more where I can let my creative side thrive.  As a Full Stack Web Developer I will get the best of both worlds.
